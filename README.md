# WorkManagerGuide
WorkManager with Jetpack Compose

Android WorkManager is a background processing library which is used to execute background tasks which should run in a guaranteed way but not necessarily immediately. With WorkManager we can enqueue our background processing even when the app is not running and the device is rebooted for some reason. WorkManager also lets us define constraints necessary to run the task e.g. network availability before starting the background task
